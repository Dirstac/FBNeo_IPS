Overall/93′ Optimized (v1.40 Easy)

Hack by AzStar

Date 2020-09-17

Description:
“93′ Optimized” is a hack of Contra on the NES based on “Contra Aoi Version“.

The level designs are mixed with some designs from the original game, “93′ Super Contra II”, and some new designs.

Enemy AI is almost the same as “Contra Aoi Version”. But the difficulty is easier…

Weapons are better than the original game. And like the NDS’ Contra 4, they have the upgraded system, and you have the secondary weapon slot to switch. So be good at using any weapons to run through every stage…
