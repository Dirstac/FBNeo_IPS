Hack by Pie-jacker875

Date 2020-09-02

Description:
Rather than being an imitation of the infamous Kaizō Mario World hack, this is merely a hack with all new levels for Super Mario Bros. 2 (AKA The Lost Levels). Not intended to be ridiculously challenging, but a much needed expansion for people who have played the original game to death. Experienced players should find this to be challenging, but not insurmountable. Abstaining from the use of save states is encouraged.
